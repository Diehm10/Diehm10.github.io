        <p>My landmark project</p>

        <p>Carroll Park has everything you could ever want. The entrance to the park is shaded by the giant tree serving as a center to the park. From there I could turn left and go to the jungle gym and sprinkler; I could go straight and relax under the trees while hearing the sound of birds chirping; or I could turn right and play the sport I desire. The colorful beauty follows me throughout the entire park. So many have been entranced by this spectacular scenery, but of course my favorite place as a kid was the sand pit. There are endless opportunities for fun in Carroll Park.
</p>
<p>Carroll park is a place for everyone. No matter if you're a kid or an adult you can relate to one another. There are kids running around all edges of the park partaking in mindless fun. The shaded benches are where the baby sitters reside all getting to know one another and having a good time. On either side of the sprinklers you can find a jungle gym. On the right you can find the one meant for the smaller children and on the left the one for more mature kids. The sound of parents talking and kids screaming while playing tag radiates into every inch of the park. No matter who you are Carroll Park is the place for you.
</p>
<p> Carroll park may not be physically different then many other parks but that's not what makes it special. What makes Carroll park special are the people who reside there. I could play there for hours. Meeting new friends was part of the fun! I was the most extroverted kid you would have ever seen. I would walk up to anybody who looked like fun and would ask “can I play with you.”. They always said yes, of course. The people within Carroll Ppark have formed a bond and a community over the countless hours spent there. Parents will ask other adults to watch their kid after meeting them just five minutes ago. As a child I quickly formed a bond with the people and the park itself. People create life lasting friendships with others at the park, not only kids but adults too. Once you spend your time at Carroll Park you become part of the park.
</p>
<p>Carroll Park was a place of dreams for a kid like me. It had everything I could ever want. It has a draw to it which not many other places have. You may not see it at first but once you go  and spend your time there it all becomes clear. After indulging in activities at Carroll Park you become part of its community. You will begin to feel that draw and wonder what it is coming from. It is coming from the joy you experienced at the park and your mind is trying to pull you back.
